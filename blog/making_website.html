      <h1>MAKING OF THE WEBSITE</h1>
</div>
      <p>
        I started making this website during the COVID-19 Quarantine in July 2020.
        I started from scratch, familiarizing myself with GitHub, learning about HTML, CSS, and JS, and about website domains and hosting.
        This website is hosted using GitHub Pages and the domain is from Domain.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a tutorial on how this website was made:
      </p>
      <h5>Getting a Domain Name</h5>
      <p>
        I had a code from a hackathon, so my domain name was free for a year.
        Without a code, domains are not expensive and are generally paid for on a yearly basis, although the website protection may cost up to $50.

      </p>
      <h5>Creating a GitHub Pages Site</h5>
      <p>
        To host using GitHub, you need to create a GitHub account first.  Then, create a repository that is named <i>yourusernamehere.github.io</i> to create a personal website.
        You must type that text exactly to create your personal/organization page.  Only one personal/organization page is allowed per account.
      </p>
      <h5>Using Your Own Domain with GitHub Pages</h5>
      <p>
        This part is a bit tricky to understand.  To direct your GitHub Site to your own domain name, go to Settings.
        Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" heading and find where it says "custom domain."
        Enter your custom domain here.  GitHub suggests using the www subdomain with your custom domain.
