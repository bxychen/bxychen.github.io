      <h1>MAKING OF THE WEBSITE</h1>
</div>
      <p>
        I started making this website during the COVID-19 Quarantine in July 2020.
        I started from scratch, familiarizing myself with GitHub, learning about HTML, CSS, and JS, and about website domains and hosting.
        This website is hosted using GitHub Pages and the domain is from Domain.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a tutorial on how this website was made:
      </p>
      <h6>Getting a Domain Name</h6>
      <p>
        I had a code from a hackathon, so my domain name was free for a year.
        Without a code, domains are not expensive and are generally paid for on a yearly basis, although the website protection may cost up to $50.
